    <h1>Coffee Maker</h1>
    <div class="section" id="intro">
        <div class="intro-text">
            This machine is able to brew a cup of coffee within minutes with
            only water and coffee pods.
            <br>
            To use the machine, one must fill the
            container with their desired amount of water, insert a coffee pod
            into the slot, close the drawer, and press the brew button.
            <br>
            This makes getting a cup of coffee more convenient and affordable.

                        <li>However, forgot to add water before brewing</li>
                        <li>Turned off, then added water to container before pressing brew button</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>First time use</li>
                        <li>To make coffee at home instead of needing to buy; cheaper alternative</li>
                        <li>Compared to other machines, this machine was more intuitive due to less buttons and fewer
                            possible actions; however, wished for more labels to add clarity</li>
                        <li>Disadvantage - bad for environment and only has single use; powdered version can
                            have multiple uses and takes up less space; can only make one cup of coffee at a time</li>

                        <li>Pressed brew button multiple times, but machine wasn't functioning; figured out that the
                            water
                            container lid had to be closed in order to start brewing</li>

                        <li>Was confusing because buttons didn't do what they expected them to do; mental model did not
                            line
                            up with machine's true functionality</li>
