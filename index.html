                    <ul>
                        <li>Understands to plug in and press power button</li>
                        <li>Put pod inside before pressing brew button</li>
                        <li>However, forgot to add water before brewing</li>
                        <li>Turned off, then added water to container before pressing brew button</li>
                        <li>Was able to successfully brew coffee</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5 class="person-header">Question Responses</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First time use</li>
                        <li>To make coffee at home instead of needing to buy; cheaper alternative</li>
                        <li>Compared to other machines, this machine was more intuitive due to less buttons and fewer
                            possible actions; however, wished for more labels to add clarity</li>
                        <li>Disadvantages because bad for environment and only has single use - powdered version can
                            have
                            multiple uses and takes up less space; can only make one cup of coffee at a time</li>
                        <li>Every day</li>
                        <li>Morning</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Confused with buttons and their function</li>
                        <li>Pressed brew button multiple times, but machine wasn't functioning; figured out that the
                            water
                            container lid had to be closed in order to start brewing</li>
                        <li>Was able to successfully brew coffee</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5 class="person-header">Question Responses</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First time use</li>
                        <li>Convenience of having quick access to coffee</li>
                        <li>Was confusing because buttons didn't do what they expected them to do; mental model did not
                            line
                            up with machine's true functionality</li>
                        <li>Advantage because of easiness and allows for quicker variety</li>
                        <li>Several times a day</li>
                        <li>Morning</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Has used in the past</li>
                        <li>For easy energy boost whenever needed</li>
                        <li>Intuitive because they have used the machine in the past</li>
                        <li>Disadvantage because it's difficult to make large quantities of coffee in a short amount of
                            time
                            with pods; however; convenience is nice</li>
                        <li>Usually once a day, but if has lots of work, multiple times a day</li>
                        <li>Morning</li>
